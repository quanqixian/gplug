# Introduction

gplug is a **general plugin management library**.

gplug is used for unified management of plugins in the application, responsible for loading, initializing, de-initializing, and unloading each plugin, and supports adding and deleting plugin libraries at runtime.

gplug is designed to separate the plugin interface and user function interface.
